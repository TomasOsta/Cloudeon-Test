# Cloudeon-Test

Following the task provided, I've created an Ansible Playbook to implement the following tasks: deploying vm with prometheus, grafana, 
alert manager and node exporter; configuring Prometheus as the data source for Grafana; configuring node data exporter as the source of 
metrics for Prometheus; making my code available on git.

As you can probbaly see I've used the codes that were avalable online an tried to put everything in one place. Unfortunately, building my own playbook is still not something that I am capable of. However, learining this from the very basics seems really interesting.
